Getting to Know the Environment
###################################################

The F5 Advanced Web Application Firewall Solutions lab is the cornerstone of the Security SME team’s continuing effort to educate F5ers, partners, and customers on ways to efficiently use F5 AWF.
This Blueprint is comprised of multiple components including xyz  just to name a few. 
This blueprint is under content revision in hopes to add additional capabilities for others to either consume existing solutions or to build new solutions that can be shared with the community.

The links below highlight core pieces of the blueprint so others can understand how to build new solutions in the environment and increasing this blueprints value to the community. 
If you are planning to access the blueprint to deploy an existing solution it is recommended that you read the How to Deploy a Solution section prior to deploying a solution.
This will be the baseline on how to work with the blueprint when deploying solutions.
The individual solution guides should provide all the relevant documentation needed for that specific solution.
